PRISM Deep Coupling Baseline Results (No Q-table)
================================================

Test: DSJC250.5 (250 vertices, 15668 edges, density=0.503)
Config: configs/dsjc250_deep_coupling.toml
Branch: fluxnet-v2-feature
Date: 2025-11-19
GPU: RTX 3060 (CUDA 12.6, compute 8.6)

Configuration
-------------
- Metaphysical Coupling: ENABLED
  - Early-phase geometry seeding: TRUE
  - Reward shaping: TRUE (scale=2.0)
  - Stress thresholds: hot=0.5, critical=0.8
- Warmstart: ENABLED (26 anchors from attempt 2+)
- Phase 2 Iterations: 10000 (8 replicas)
- FluxNet RL: Random initialization (no pretrained Q-table)
- Memetic Algorithm: NOT enabled

Results
-------
Attempts: 16
Best Chromatic Number: 41 colors
Conflicts: 0 (valid coloring)
Total Runtime: 752.144 seconds (12.5 minutes)
Average per Attempt: 47.009 seconds

GPU Verification
----------------
✅ All 5 PTX modules loaded successfully
✅ Phase 2 GPU timing: ~93s (first), ~23s (warmed)
✅ Phase 4 GPU APSP: ~132ms
✅ Phase 0 Dendritic: ~13-18ms

Geometry Coupling Evidence
--------------------------
- Attempt 1: stress=0.032, temp_max=10.16
- Attempts 2-16: stress=0.533, temp_max=12.67 (+24.7% increase)
- Temperature adaptation active across all attempts
- Consistent geometry propagation from Phase 4/6

Key Observations
---------------
1. GPU warmup effect: 4x speedup after first attempt (93s → 23s)
2. Stable convergence: All 16 attempts → 41 colors
3. Geometry coupling functional: Temperature scaling responsive
4. Reward shaping implemented but not logged (stress deltas were zero after attempt 1)
5. No telemetry JSONL exported (may need additional implementation)

Next Steps
----------
- Retrain FluxNet Q-table with geometry coupling (1000 epochs)
- Re-run with new Q-table (16 & 128 attempts, memetic enabled)
- Compare chromatic results vs baseline (expect improvement from learned policies)
