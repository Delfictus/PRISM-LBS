## 🎬 THE EXACT WORKFLOW

### Every Day (Repeat 30 times):

```
1. Open CURSOR_30_DAY_PLAN.md
2. Find today's section
3. Copy the Cursor prompt
4. Open Composer (Cmd+I)
5. Paste prompt
6. Review what Cursor generates
7. Accept or modify
8. Test (Cmd+J → cargo check)
9. Debug if needed (Cmd+L chat)
10. Commit when working
11. Update progress tracker
12. Tomorrow: Next day's prompt
```

**That's it!** Follow this pattern for 30 days and you'll have a complete MEC system.
