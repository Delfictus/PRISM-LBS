# MEC Phase M0 Artifacts

This directory captures Phase M0 validation outputs:

- `meta_registry_snapshot.json` — Merkle-backed feature registry checkpoint.
- `telemetry_schema_meta_v1.json` — Copy of the telemetry contract schema consumed by compliance.
- `determinism_manifest_meta_sample.json` — Determinism manifest annotated with meta hashes.

Artifacts are regenerated by running `cargo run --bin meta_bootstrap` followed by 
`python3 PRISM-AI-UNIFIED-VAULT/scripts/compliance_validator.py --strict`.
